        <strong>Krishnakumar Kunnath </strong>(23 August 1968 - 31 May 2022),
        popularly known as KK, was an Indian playback singer. He recorded songs
        primarily in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada language. Noted for his
        versatility in a variety of music genres, KK is regarded among the
        greatest playback singers of India.He was a recipient of two Screen
        Awards, alongwith nominations for six Filmfare Awards. KK began his
        career by singing advertising jingles and made his film debut in 1996
        with a song in Maachis. KK released his debut album, Pal in 1999. The
        songs "Pal" and "Yaaron" from the album became popular, and are used in
        school graduations. The album turned out to be his career breakthrough.
        The song "Tadap Tadap Ke" from the 1999 film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam,
        earned him his first Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer
        nomination.KK had no formal musical training.According to film director
        Mahesh Bhatt, "KK had an emotional bandwidth which echoed all the
        seasons of the heart. He could be frivolous, romantic and anguished. He
        could go into the depths, talk about the wonder and magic of life."KK
        believed that it was unimportant for a singer's face to be seen, but "a
        singer must be heard".In a 2019 interview, he said that he felt
        comfortable with a microphone but awkward in front of a camera. KK
        valued and "fiercely" protected his privacy.He did not want his singing
        to be associated with a particular actor and preferred singing for a
        number of actors.He is widely regarded as a highly versatile
        singer."Till the end, he remained a rage in the concert circuit and will
        be remembered as the singer who became the voice of the heart".In 2023,
        a statue of KK was installed at Gurudas Mahavidyalaya in Kolkata, the
        same place where he performed his last concert.Several singers like
        Arijit Singh, Shaan, Sunidhi Chauhan, Sonu Nigam, Shilpa Rao and others
        have given a tribute to KK, by singing his songs during their concerts.
